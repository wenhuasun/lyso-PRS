# Lysosomal polygenic risk score in Parkinson’s disease across populations.

# Summary

This is the online repository for the manuscript titled "Lysosomal polygenic risk score in Parkinson’s disease across populations". This study focuses on 1) evaluation of lysosomal polygenic risk score (lyso-PRS) performance for PD risk across populations using the GP2 Neurobooster genotyping array. 2) Comparison of the lyso-PRS across idiopathic PD (iPD), GBA1-PD, non-manifesting GBA1 carriers (NMC), and healthy controls (HC) in the European population and assessment of the lyso-PRS association with GBA1-PD status. 3) Regression analysis of the lyso-PRS and clinical outcomes in the PD patients of European population.

# Data statement
All GP2 data are hosted in collaboration with the Accelerating Medicines Partnership in Parkinson’s disease, and are available via application on the website (https://amp-pd.org/register-for-amp-pd). For up-to-date information on GP2 data acquisition, access, and policies, visit https://gp2.org/. 
All data was using GP2 release 11 (https://zenodo.org/records/17753486). Genotyping imputation, quality control, ancestry prediction, and processing were performed using GenoTools (v1.0.0), publicly available on GitHub.
Data of European Tuebingen Parkinson cohort dataset are available in an anonymized format on request to: kathrin.brockmann@uni-tuebingen.de.
